## Objective

To practice using sessions and PassportJS for authentication. The app is an exclusive clubhouse where any members can write anonymous posts but only those who joined the exclusive clubhouse can see the author of a post. Full details can be found on [The Odin Project's page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-nodejs-members-only).

## Built With

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [PassportJS](https://www.passportjs.org/)

## Features

The clubhouse requires registering an account and logging in in order to make a post and see others' posts. Once logged in, the user is redirected to their dashboard where they can see all users' posts (author names shown as "Anonymous" if the user is not part of the private clubhouse). Users who are admins have permission to delete anyone's posts.
